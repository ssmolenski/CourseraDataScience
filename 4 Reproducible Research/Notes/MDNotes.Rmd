This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and Microsoft Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

To turn a markdown document into a pdf, run:  

```  
library(knitr)  
library(rmarkdown)  
render("filename.rmd", "pdf_document")  
```

For more options see:

```
?render
```

# Sections
  
A section header is proceeded by a number of `#`'s, where the `#` of hashes represents the level. For example:
    
## Sub-Section

### Sub-Sub-Section

# Lists

Enumerated lists are simply lines preceded by `1.`. For example,

1. First item
2. Second item.
1. Numbers don't matter.
    1. Sub-list
    5. Again, numbers don't matter.
1. Back to original ordering.

1. Start of a new list.


For unordered lists, simply preface with `*` or `-` or `+`:

- first
+ second
* third
    - Sub list
    + another
* fourth


# Tables

Tables are generated using ASCII.

| Name | Height | Weight |
|:-----|:------:|:------:|
| Bob  | 6'1"   | 195    |
| Sue  | 5'4"   | 134    |

### Note:
* The second line (with the `:`'s and `-`'s) separates the header from the body. The `:`'s refer to alignment (`---` is left-aligned, `--:` is right- and `:-:` is centered). There must be at least three characters between the `|`'s, though more `-`'s is fine.  
* White space is ignored and only included to make editing easy. 

# R Markdown

RMarkdown extends Markdown to easily embed R code by creating a chunk wrapped in triple backticks. To also run the code include {r} :


```{r}
summary(cars)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

You can pass options to chunks. For example, `{r, eval = FALSE}` will display R code but not execute it. Here are some useful options:

* `echo = FALSE`: Display the output but suppress the code.
* `results = 'asis'`: Prevents further processing of the output. Useful if a table created in R (e.g. using kable or xtable). Not generally needed otherwise
* `engine ='enginename'`: You can actually run other code. For example, `engine = 'stata'` runs the code through Stata,  `engine = 'bash'` runs linux command line code.
* `message = FALSE` and `warning = FALSE`: Suppresses R messages and warnings respectively. Useful when loading packages.

In-line R code can be included by wrapping a call to r max(x) in single backticks. Excluding the r part renders the code as code without processing it: `max(x)`

# Equations

Markdown and RMarkdown support LaTeX math equations. Inline e.g. `\(y = \beta x + \epsilon\)` : \(y = \beta x + \epsilon\) Stand alone equations similarly:

```
\[
  y = \beta x + \epsilon
\]
```

\[
  y = \beta x + \epsilon
\]
